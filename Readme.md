## Documentation

How the documentation is organized.

A high-level overview of how it’s organized will help you know where to look for certain things:

- [☑ How-Tos](#how-tos) guide you through the steps involved in addressing key problems and use-cases. They are more advanced than tutorials and assume some knowledge of how the Scrum-Poker works.
- [👷 Guides](#guides) describe best practices and principles we follow.
- [🗃 References](#references) contain technical reference for APIs and other aspects of the app. They describe how it works and how to use it but assume that you have a basic understanding of key concepts.
- [👩‍🏫 Explanations](#explanations) about the architecture and other stuff.
